# Getting Started

This guide takes you from nothing to a finished SEO audit zip. Pick an install path, wire up your MCP client, run your first audit.

## Install

The server is a thin MCP wrapper (`server.py`) that drives a separate **LibreCrawl** engine. However you install, you end up with two things running: the engine on port `5080` and the MCP on port `5081`.

### Option A — one-liner installer

The fastest path. Handles Python, the Dockerized LibreCrawl backend, and your client config.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityaarsharma/librecrawl-technical-seo-audit-mcp/main/install.sh | bash
```

It asks three questions — target client, optional Google PageSpeed key, optional GSC integration — then writes a ready-to-use MCP entry into your Claude / Cursor / Codex / Windsurf config.

### Option B — Docker (full stack)

Best for self-hosting or a VPS. Brings up the LibreCrawl engine **and** the MCP together, health-gated, in one command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityaarsharma/librecrawl-technical-seo-audit-mcp.git
cd librecrawl-technical-seo-audit-mcp
docker compose up --build
```

- MCP endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:5081/mcp`
- The `mcp` service waits until LibreCrawl reports healthy before starting.
- First build takes a few minutes (LibreCrawl pulls Chromium for JS rendering).
- Audit zips land in `./reports`.

Stop with `docker compose down` (add `-v` to also drop the shared data volume).

### Option C — manual

Python 3.10+, plus a LibreCrawl backend you run yourself (the Docker path above is the easiest way to get one).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityaarsharma/librecrawl-technical-seo-audit-mcp.git
cd librecrawl-technical-seo-audit-mcp
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
LIBRECRAWL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5080 python server.py
```

By default the MCP serves HTTP on `127.0.0.1:5081`. Set `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio` to run it over stdio instead (see [Connect your MCP client](#connect-your-mcp-client)).

---

## Connect your MCP client

There are two transports. **HTTP** (default) is best when the MCP runs as a long-lived service (Docker, PM2, a VPS). **stdio** is best when your client launches the process itself.

### Claude Code / Claude Desktop — HTTP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "librecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:5081/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Claude Desktop config: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS)
- Claude Code: add via your project/user MCP config, then restart the session.

### Cursor / Windsurf / Codex / Continue.dev — stdio

Run the server in stdio mode by launching it directly, with `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "librecrawl": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/librecrawl-technical-seo-audit-mcp/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "LIBRECRAWL_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:5080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the venv's Python (`/path/to/venv/bin/python`) if you installed manually. The LibreCrawl backend still needs to be running separately.

After editing config, **fully restart the client** so it reconnects.

## Your first audit

Just ask your assistant in plain language. Under the hood it calls the tools:

```text
You:   Audit https://example.com — full site, no caps

Agent: → librecrawl_start_chunked_audit(url="https://example.com", total_max_pages=10000)
         returns a session_id in < 2s
       → polls librecrawl_audit_status(session_id) every ~25s
         crawling · pages_done: 47 · current_delay_ms: 250
         crawling · pages_done: 312 · p95: 480ms · err_rate: 0%
         done · pages_done: 534 · artifacts_ready: true
       → librecrawl_audit_zip(session_id, auto_cleanup=True)
         saves example.com-<timestamp>.zip locally, wipes the server

You:   Show me broken pages + broken external links + hreflang errors
Agent: → unzips, filters per-page.csv and external-links.csv, prints the tables
```

You never call tools by hand — the agent picks them. See **[TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)** for the full list.

## Where the report goes

Each audit preserves the 8 legacy zip files: `SUMMARY.txt`, a branded PDF, its Markdown source, and 5 CSVs (`per-page`, `sitemap-recon`, `external-links`, `content-audit`, `extended-checks`). When V3 is enabled, the same zip also includes 80-rule coverage, remediation tasks, score, portable snapshot/diff, manual review, collected provider evidence, and enhanced Markdown/PDF reports.

- **Docker:** written to `./reports` in the repo.
- **Manual / installer:** written to `REPORTS_DIR` (default `~/librecrawl-reports`).

The audit is **ephemeral** — once the zip is downloaded with `auto_cleanup=True`, the server deletes the session, the artifact files, and the upstream crawl record. Your local zip is the only copy.
